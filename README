I cleaned a little the tree :
the symboic links are a bad practice with cvs so.... removed and moved 
glenn-grimoire.debranched to glenn-grimoire

I moved glenn-grimoire.branched to retired_spells with some others outdated 
directories (like moonbase...)

now the main tree only contain debranched spells
