xCHM can show the contents tree if one is available, print the displayed
page, change fonts faces and size, work with bookmarks, do the usual
history stunts (forward, back, home), provide a searchable index and seach
for text in the whole book. The search is a fast B-tree search, based on
the internal \$FIftiMain file found inside indexed .chm archives, and it
can be customized to search in content or just the topics' titles.
