GSM 06.10 compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling
rate, i.e. a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for compatibility
with typical UNIX applications, our implementation turns frames of 160
16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s).
The quality of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker
recognition; even music often survives transcoding in recognizable 
form (given the bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).
