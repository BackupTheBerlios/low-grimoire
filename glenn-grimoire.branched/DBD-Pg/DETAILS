DBD-Pg is a PostgreSQL interface for Perl5 using DBI.

DBI (Database independent interface) is a database access API (Application
Programming Interface) for the Perl Language. It provides a consistent
database interface independent of the actual database being used.

PostgreSQL is an ORDBMS (Object oriented Relational Database Management
System). It runs on a variety of different operating systems and it is
open-source.
