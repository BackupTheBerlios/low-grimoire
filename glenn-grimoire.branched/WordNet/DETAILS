    SHORT="WordNet® is an online lexical reference system."
cat << EOF
WordNet® is an online lexical reference system whose design is inspired
by current psycholinguistic theories of human lexical memory. English
nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are organized into synonym sets,
each representing one underlying lexical concept. Different relations
link the synonym sets.
