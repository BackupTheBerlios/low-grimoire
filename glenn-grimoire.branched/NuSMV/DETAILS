NuSMV is a reimplementation and extension of SMV, the first model checker
based on BDDs. NuSMV has been designed to be an open architecture for
model checking, which can be reliably used for the verification of
industrial designs, as a core for custom verification tools, as a testbed
for formal verification techniques, and applied to other research areas.
