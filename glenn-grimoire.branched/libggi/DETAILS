cat << EOF
GGI aims at unifying the way applications access the user display by
defining a generic abstraction of the notion of graphic display. 

Generally speaking, a display is a 2D surface that can be drawn on and
with which a user can interact. Whatever the physical displays actually
are (a TV screen or an X11 window) they always have this basic in common.
Of course, they all have specific characteristics and low-level access
methods, but the idea behind GGI is that this difference is not a concern
to the application.
