ASD will eventually be a full featured drop-in replacement for Esound.
 ASD will implement all features of Esound, plus:
    * Capture/full-duplex facility (DONE)
    * Multiple input sources (DONE)
    * Multiple output sinks (DONE)
    * Multiple links between sinks and sources (DONE)
    * Multiple output sync samplerate synchronisation (e.g. use two normal soundcards do achieve real quadrophonic sound) (PART)
    * Very low latency (Suitable for games) (PART, not optimized, currently as bad as 180msec)
    * EsounD compatibility (Use ESD-aware programs to connect to ASD) (DONE)
    * Runtime configuration
    * Implicit sample format conversion (DONE)
    * Different types of sources:
          o socket (client-program) (DONE)
          o unix-fifo (DONE)
          o unix-pipe
          o oss-dsp (DONE)
          o alsa-dsp
          o sine-generator
          o silence-generator
          o noise-generator
          o rate-fixer
          o http-stream
          o udp-receive
    * Different types of sinks:
          o socket (client-program) (DONE)
          o unix-fifo (DONE)
          o unix-pipe
          o oss-dsp (DONE)
          o alsa-dsp
          o null
          o rate-fixer
          o http-stream
          o udp-broadcast
    * Different interfaces:
          o asd-compatible tcp-inet (DONE)
          o asd-compatible unix-socket (DONE)
          o esound-compatible tcp-inet (DONE)
          o esound-compatible unix-socket (DONE)
          o http-compatible tcp-inet (PART)
    * Secure multiple user access (PART)
    * Saving of different server layouts to XML (PART)
    * Fine grainedLatency/throughput measuring facility (DONE)
    * Arbitrary bit depth and sample rates (PART)
    * Low latency mode for telephony-applications. When this is activated all data is passed between the device and the application without further processing or mixing.
    * Gtk+ based configuration program
    * Gtk+ library with controls for ASD configuration issues
    * and much more
