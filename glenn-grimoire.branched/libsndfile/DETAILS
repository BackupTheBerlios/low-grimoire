cat << EOF
Libsndfile is a C library for reading and writing files containing sampled
sound (such as MS Windows WAV and the Apple/SGI AIFF format) through one
standard library interface.
It was designed to handle both little-endian (such as WAV) and big-endian
(such as AIFF) data, and to compile and run correctly on little-endian
(such as Intel and DEC/Compaq Alpha) processor systems as well as big-endian
processor systems such as Motorola 68k, Power PC, MIPS and Sparc. Hopefully
the design of the library will also make it easy to extend for reading and
writing new sound file formats.
