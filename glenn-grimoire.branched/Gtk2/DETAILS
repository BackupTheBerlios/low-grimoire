Perl bindings to the 2.x series of the Gtk+ graphical user interface
library. This module allows you to write graphical user interfaces in a
perlish and object-oriented way, freeing you from the casting and memory
management in C, yet remaining very close in spirit to original API.  Find
out more about Gtk+ at http://www.gtk.org.
