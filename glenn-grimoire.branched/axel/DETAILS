Axel does the same thing any other accelerator does: 
it opens more than one HTTP/FTP connection per download 
and each connection transfers its own, separate, part of 
the file. It may sound weird, but it works very well 
in practice. For example, some FTP sites limit the speed of 
each connection, therefore opening more than one connection 
at a time multiplies the allowable bandwidth.
