stream << EOF
libpixregion is a generic library for manipulating pixel regions. A
PixRegion is a set of Y-X banded rectangles that cover the desired
region.

The original code for libxregion was part of the reference X server
implementation of the X Window System. A modified copy of the code
also exists in the Xlib client library. libpixregion was formed so
that both the X server and client libraries could share common code
for region manipulation.

libpixregion is also intended to be applicable outside of the X Window
System. The public interface of libpixregion does not depend on any
part of the X Window System.
