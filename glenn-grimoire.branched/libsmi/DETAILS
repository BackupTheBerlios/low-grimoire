cat << EOF
The core of the libsmi distribution is a library that allows management
applications to access SMI MIB module definitions. On top of this library,
there are tools to check, analyze dump, convert, and compare MIB
definitions. Finally, the distribution contains a steadily maintained and
revised archive of all IETF and IANA maintained standard MIB and PIB
modules.
