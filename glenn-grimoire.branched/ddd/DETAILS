GNU DDD is a graphical front-end for command-line debuggers such as GDB, 
DBX, WDB, Ladebug, JDB, XDB, the Perl debugger, or the Python debugger.
Besides usual front-end features such as viewing source texts, DDD has
become famous through its interactive graphical data display, where data
structures are displayed as graphs.
