This is the homepage of frox. It is a transparent ftp proxy which is
released under the GPL. It optionally supports caching (either through
an external http cache (eg. squid), or by maintaining a cache locally),
and/or running a virus scanner, on downloaded files. It is written with
security in mind, and in the default setup it runs as a non root user in
a chroot jail.
