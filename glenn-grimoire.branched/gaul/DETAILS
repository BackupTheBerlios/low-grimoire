The Genetic Algorithm Utility Library (or, GAUL for short) is a flexible
programming library designed to aid in the development of applications
that use genetic, or evolutionary, algorithms. It provides data structures
and functions for handling and manipulation of the data required for a
genetic algorithm. Additional stochastic algorithms are provided for
comparison to the genetic algorithms. Much of the functionality is also
available through a simple S-Lang interface.
