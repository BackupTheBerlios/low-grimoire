libopensc is a library for accessing smart card devices using PC/SC Lite
middleware package. It is also the core library of the OpenSC project.
Basic functionality (e.g. SELECT FILE, READ BINARY) should work on any
ISO 7816-4 compatible smart card. Encryption and decryption using private
keys on the smart card is at the moment possible only with PKCS #15
compatible cards, such as the FINEID (Finnish electronic ID card) card
manufactured by Setec.
