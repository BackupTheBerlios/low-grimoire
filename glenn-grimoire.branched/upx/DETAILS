    UPX is a versatile executable packer with the following features:
        * excellent compression ratio: typically compresses better than
	  WinZip/zip/gzip, use UPX to decrease the size of your
	  distribution !
        * very fast decompression: ~10 MB/sec on an ancient Pentium 133,
	  ~200 MB/sec on an Athlon XP 2000+.
        * no memory overhead for your compressed executables because of
	  in-place decompression.
        * safe: you can list, test and unpack your executables. Also, a
	  checksum of both the compressed and uncompressed file is
	  maintained internally.
        * universal: UPX can pack a number of executable formats:
              o atari/tos
              o djgpp2/coff
              o dos/com
              o dos/exe
              o dos/sys
              o linux/386
              o rtm32/pe
              o tmt/adam
              o watcom/le (supporting DOS4G, PMODE/W, DOS32a and CauseWay)
              o win32/pe
        * portable: UPX is written in portable endian-neutral C++
        * extendable: because of the class layout it\'s very easy to add
	  new executable formats or new compression algorithms
        * free: UPX is distibuted with full source code under the GNU
	  General Public License, and may be used freely even with
	  commercial programs.
