wavemon is a ncurses-based monitoring application for wireless network
devices. It currently works under Linux with devices that are supported by
the wireless extensions by Jean Tourrilhes (included in Kernel 2.4 and
higher), e.g. the Lucent Orinoco cards.

Key features:
- overview screen, displaying all important information like device
  configuration, encryption and power management parameters and network
  information at once
- adaptive level bargraphs for link quality, signal/noise strength and
  signal-to-noise ratio
- customizeable "level alarm" feature that notices the user of changes in
  signal level strength audibly and/or visually
- full-screen level histogram displaying signal/noise levels and SNR
- list of access points in range
- menu-based configuration from within the program
