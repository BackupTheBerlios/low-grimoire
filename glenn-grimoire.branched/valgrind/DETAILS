cat << EOF
Valgrind is a GPL'd tool to help you find memory-management problems in
your programs. When a program is run under Valgrind's supervision, all
reads and writes of memory are checked, and calls to malloc/new/free/delete
are intercepted. As a result, Valgrind can detect problems such as:

    * Use of uninitialised memory
    * Reading/writing memory after it has been free'd
    * Reading/writing off the end of malloc'd blocks
    * Reading/writing inappropriate areas on the stack
    * Memory leaks -- where pointers to malloc'd blocks are lost forever
    * Passing of uninitialised and/or unaddressible memory to system calls
    * Mismatched use of malloc/new/new [] vs free/delete/delete []
    * Some misuses of the POSIX pthreads API 

Valgrind tracks each byte of memory in the original program with nine
status bits, one of which tracks addressibility of that byte, while the
other eight track the validity of the byte. As a result, it can detect the
use of single uninitialised bits, and does not report spurious errors on
bitfield operations.
