LibGGIMisc is a place to put support for graphics target features
which are not deserving their own special extensions.  Right
now this means basically some VGA adaptor features -- 
getting and waiting for the raster position, using a hardware
horizontal splitline feature, and loading/unloading font data 
from hardware text modes.
