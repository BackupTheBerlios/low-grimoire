Kahakai is a fork of the Waimea window manager, with the intent to create
a language agnostic scriptable window manager, while maintaining the
original features of Waimea, and extending upon them. Kahakai is
pronounced with the \'ca\' in car, the \'ha\' in hard, and \'ki\' from kite.

By \"language agnostic\", we mean that the scripts which control actions in
the window manager are not language specific, they can be written in any
language supported by SWIG. For starters, we plan on supporting Python
with the addition of Ruby and Perl shortly thereafter.
