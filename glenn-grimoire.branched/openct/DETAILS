It all started with a reader driver library - I wanted to write a
library to provide a framework for people writing drivers for smart
card readers. The idea was to provide all the usualy stuff (T=0, T=1,
serial vs USB device handling, etc) in a single place, and reduce
driver writing to interaction with the device itself.
