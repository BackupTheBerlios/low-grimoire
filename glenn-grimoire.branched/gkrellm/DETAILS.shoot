This Plugin gives easy access to Screen Lock and Screen Shoot facility.
For Screen capture this uses ImageMagick. Displays animation(Screen Saver
like) along with 'Lock' and 'Shoot' button to be clicked on. With Screen
Shoot one can either grab a window, selected area or whole screen, also one
can delay the Screen Shoot by given number of seconds. One other feature
is that grabbed image can be viewed by given image viewer. Pressing 'Lock'
button will lock the screen and starts your screen saver.
