LONG="
CHMLIB is a library for dealing with Microsoft ITSS/CHM format files. Right
now, it is a very simple library, but sufficient for dealing with all of
the .chm files I've come across. Due to the fairly well-designed indexing
built into this particular file format, even a small library is able to
gain reasonably good performance indexing into ITSS archives.
