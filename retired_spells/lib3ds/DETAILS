The 3D Studio File Format Library is an overall software library for
managing 3D-Studio Release 3 and 4 ".3DS" files. It is a free alternative
to Autodesk's 3DS File Toolkit for managing 3DS files. It started out in
1996 to be released in 1999 under the GNU General Public License (GPL) as
Open-Source software. In 2000, the library was completely rewritten in
ANSI-C to attain more hardware platform independence.
