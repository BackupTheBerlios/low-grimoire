kio_fish is a kioslave for KDE 2/3 that lets you view and manipulate your remote files using just a simple shell account and some standard unix commands on the remote machine. You get full filesystem access without setting up a server - no NFS, Samba, ... needed.

Usage is really simple: open up a konqueror window (or use the Alt-F2 dialog) and type 'fish://user@remote.machi.ne'. kio_fish will ask you for the password, if any is needed, and you will start out in your home directory. Now you can do everything you do on your local hard disk.
