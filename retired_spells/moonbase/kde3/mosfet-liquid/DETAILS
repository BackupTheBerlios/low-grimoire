* First style to use my translucent menu code, (well, actually my MegaGradient 
was first but there was never an official release of that), and was the first 
style to alphablend widgets.

* Fast and efficent alphablending of widgets. Many widgets now utilize a full 
alpha channel with negligable impact on performance or memory consumption.

* High performance. No scaling is required, and caching (thus memory usage) is 
kept to a minimum. Custom tile drawing and blending code is used for maximum 
speed. I wanted to create a style engine that both looked cool and is usable 
on an everyday basis by people doing stuff like compiling all day. I've even 
gotten emails from a couple users using it over remote X terminals and the 
report good speed results! :)

* Colors are fully configurable. This is really cool with this style. It also 
handles custom colors like KCalc's correctly. Check out the screenshots.

* Mouse Hover is supported for Pushbuttons, ComboBoxes, RadioButtons, 
CheckBoxes, and ScrollBars. This doesn't use the crappy "draw a box around the 
widget" mouse hover, either, but makes the widget appear to light up.

* Automagically themes the KDE panel.
