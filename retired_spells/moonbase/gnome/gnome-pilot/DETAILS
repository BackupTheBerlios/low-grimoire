part of the GNOME project.

The goal is a daemon both for the single pilot user, 
but also for eg. office use, where many pilots and many people are 
involved. And a complete set of office ready extras.
 
Among the features that the package will offer, are
  
* CORBA based daemon
* Support for multiple pilots/users and cradles
* Management of users an pilots
* A suite of conduits for GNOME applications
* GNOME compliant utilities
