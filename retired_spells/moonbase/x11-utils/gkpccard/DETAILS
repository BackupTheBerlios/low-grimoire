gkPCcard is a PCMCIA card monitor plugin for GKrellM. I made this
plugin 'cause there was no feature in GKrellM that provided this, but
I wanted to see which cards are inserted in the slots of my laptop.

    * Displays the name of the card that is inserted
    * Shows an image for each socket indicating whether a card is inserted
    * Supports theming.
    * Includes animation.
    * Right-clicking the plugin opens a popup where you can execute commands on the inserted cards.
    * PCcard schemes are supported. You can choose on from the popup.
