Mp3Kult3 is an application for KDE 3 (K Desktop Environment)
Mp3Kult organizes your mp3 collection in a Mysql database.
It can read Mp3 Tag and song information 
(length, bit rate, sample rate etc...), make playlists, 
play song with an external player (xmms, gqmpeg),
find a song in database,(base and advanced search) and make 
a copy of a playlist on your hard disk 
(to play the playlist without inserting cdroms).
Mp3Kult3 can scan recursivly directories, looking for mp3s and
automatically mount, umount, eject cdroms before/after job.
