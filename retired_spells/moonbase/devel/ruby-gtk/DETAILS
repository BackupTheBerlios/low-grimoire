cat << EOF
From the website:    
* GTK+ is a rich, powerful and modern GUI toolkit.
* GTK+ objects are represented naturally in Ruby as simple Ruby objects.
You can do natural GUI programming and take advantage of the beauty of Ruby's syntax.
* The signal handling mechanism maps into Ruby blocks very well.
This makes using signal handlers very easy and natural in Ruby.
