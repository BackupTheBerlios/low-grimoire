cat << EOF
LBreakout is a nice breakout-style arcade game in the manner of Arkanoid.
30 levels are waiting for you to be cleared and loads of power-ups will help 
you with that task: extra balls, energy balls, extra lifes, weapons, glue, 
bonus floors, paddle expansion and extra score. And, of course, there are some 
maluses you should try to avoid like paddle freeze or paddle shrinkage.
