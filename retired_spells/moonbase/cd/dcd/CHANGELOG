Chuck Busby:15feb2002

* Changed UPDATED from hard date to $DATE

* Checked BUILD and DETAILS for <tab> : found none

* Cast dcd and tested.  Works ok

* Checked dependencies: none

* Emailed current maintainer alerting of new update.  
  Asked if would like to pass the torch.

* Went to Home Depot for washers.

* Upon returning I got response from Kyle that he will not
  relenquish maintainership.  He also intends to reject this 
  spell.  I am moving it to init-failed where it can rot...

  Additionally I will reject the changes.
  /devices/cdroms/cdrom0 is not my music playing CD.
  It is my DVD/CDRW CD.  Naturally I can not over-write
  it with a symbolic link in the devfs directory.
