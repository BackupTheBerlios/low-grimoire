SWIG is a compiler that makes it easy to integrate 
C and C++ code with scripting languages including 
Perl, Tcl, Python, Guile, Ruby, MzScheme, and Java.
Swig takes a set of ANSI C/C++ declarations (with 
optional annotations) and generates an interface 
for them to your favorite scripting language.
