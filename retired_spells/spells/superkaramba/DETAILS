SuperKaramba is a tool that allows anyone to easily create and run little 
interactive widgets on a KDE desktop. Widgets are defined in a simple text 
file and can be augmented with Python code to make them interactive. Current 
widgets include everything from simple news headline displays to complete 
custom replacements for kicker, the KDE toolbar.
