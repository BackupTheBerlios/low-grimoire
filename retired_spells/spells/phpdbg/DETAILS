DBG is a PHP debugger and profiler. It makes it much 
easier to discover the origins of problems and bugs in 
PHP scripts. It's equipped with the ability to backtrace 
errors. It shows local and global variables as well as 
parameters which have been passed to all nested function 
calls at any point of execution. Among other things, it 
allows you to execute scripts in a step-by-step manner, 
set breakpoints (including conditional ones), evaluate 
expressions, and watch variables. The profiler allows 
you to find bottlenecks in PHP code at the functions 
level as well as the modules level and even the source lines level.
