cat << EOF
The Kawa Scheme System is a full Scheme implementation, completely written in Java. 
Scheme functions and files are automatically compiled into Java byte-codes. Kawa 
does some optimizations, and the compiled code runs at a reasonable speed. It 
provides the usual read-eval-print loop, as well as batch modes. The Kawa 
compilation framework is also useful for implementing other languages on top 
of JVM. There is active development of XQuery (the XML query language), and less 
active development of Emacs Lisp, Common Lisp, and EcmaScript.
