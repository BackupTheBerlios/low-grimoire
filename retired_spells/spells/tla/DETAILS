LONG="
arch is a modern replacement for CVS, specifically designed for the 
distributed development needs of open source projects. It has uniquely 
good support for development on branches (especially good merging tools), 
distributed repositories (every developer can have branches in their 
own repository), changeset-oriented project management (arch commits 
changes to multiple files at once), and, of course, file and directory renaming.
