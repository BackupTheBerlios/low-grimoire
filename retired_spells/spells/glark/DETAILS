glark offers grep-like searching of text files, with very powerful, complex regular expressions 
(e.g., "/foo\w+/ and /bar[^\d]*baz$/ within 4 lines of each other"). It also highlights the 
matches, displays context (preceding and succeeding lines), does case-insensitive matches, and 
automatic exclusion of non-text files. It supports most options from the GNU version of grep
