  SHORT="An advanced alternative, asynchronous resolver"

  LONG="
  adns is a replacement resolver library. Its programming 
  interface is at once easier to use and more powerful than 
  the standard libresolv. For example, responses are automatically 
  decoded into native C formats, and it is possible to launch 
  many queries and once and deal with the responses asynchronously.
