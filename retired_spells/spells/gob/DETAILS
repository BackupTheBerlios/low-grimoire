GTK Object Builder (GOB) is a simple preprocessor for easily creating GTK objects. It reads a class 
description file with inline C code and produces .c and .h object files for you. It allows you to 
easily use all of the features of the GTK object system and avoids typos by reducing the amount of 
code needed. In general, the amount of code is about the same as for OO languages such as Java or 
C++, but you still have to only use C and you get all the power of the GTK object system.
