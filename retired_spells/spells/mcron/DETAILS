  cat << EOF
  Mcron is a 100% Vixie cron replacement written in pure Guile. 
  As well as accepting traditional crontabs, it also accepts 
  configuration files written in Scheme for infinite flexibility 
  in specifying when jobs should run (it could take the system 
  load into account, for example).
