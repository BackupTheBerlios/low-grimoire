LONG="
Libart is a library for high-performance 2D graphics. It 
supports a very powerful imaging model, basically the same 
as SVG and the Java 2D API. It includes all PostScript imaging 
operations, and adds antialiasing and alpha-transparency. It 
is also highly tuned for incremental rendering. It contains data 
structures and algorithms suited to rapid, precise computation of 
Region of Interest, and a two-phase rendering pipeline optimized 
for interactive display.
