  Cheops-ng is a network management tool for mapping 
  and monitoring your network. It has host/network discovery functionality 
  and OS detection,and does a port scan of each computer to tell what 
  services are running. It can probe FTP, HTTP, ssh, email (port 25), 
  news, IMAP, and VNC to see what version and type of server is 
  running on those ports.
