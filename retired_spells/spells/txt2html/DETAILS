txt2html is a Perl program that converts plain text to HTML. 
It supports headings, lists, simple character markup, hyperlinking 
and is highly customizable. It recognizes some of the apparent 
structure of the source document (mostly whitespace and typographic layout) 
and attempts to mark that structure explicitly using HTML.
