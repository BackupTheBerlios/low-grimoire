hdup is used to back up a filesystem. Features include 
encryption of the archive (with mcrypt), compression 
of the archive (bzip/gzip/none), the ability to transfer 
the archive to a remote host or restoring from a remote 
host (with ssh), the ability to split up archives, 
and no obscure archive format (it is a normal compressed 
tar file).
