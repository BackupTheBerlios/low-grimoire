  SHORT="A window manager that supports window grouping."
  LONG="
  Pekwm is a window manager based on aewm++, but it no longer resembles it. 
  It is highly configurable, rather fast, and aimed towards being usable while 
  remaining pretty enough to look at. Features include client window grouping 
  into one window frame, automatic window size, location, grouping and title 
  rewriting properties, keychains, Xinerama support, pixmap theming, 
  and dynamic menus.
