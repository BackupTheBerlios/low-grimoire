Gauche is an R5RS Scheme implementation that aims to be a handy tool 
for daily work. Quick startup, a built-in system interface, and native 
multilingual support are some of its goals. It has an OO system similar 
to STklos and Guile. It supports UTF-8, EUC-JP, and Shift-JIS multibyte 
encodings natively.
