DjVuLibre is an open source (GPL'ed) implementation of DjVu, including
viewers, browser plugins, decoders, simple encoders, and utilities.
DjVu is a web-centric format and software platform for distributing
documents and images. DjVu can advantageously replace PDF, PS, TIFF, JPEG,
and GIF for distributing scanned documents, digital documents, or
high-resolution pictures. DjVu content downloads faster, displays and
renders faster, looks nicer on a screen, and consume less client resources
than competing formats. DjVu images display instantly and can be smoothly
zoomed and panned with no lengthy re-rendering. DjVu is used by hundreds of
academic, commercial, governmental, and non-commercial web sites around the
world.
