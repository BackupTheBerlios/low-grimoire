DESC="Kismet is a wirelesss network detector
Kismet is an 802.11 wireless network sniffer - this is different from
a normal network sniffer (such as Ethereal or tcpdump) because it
separates and identifies different wireless networks in the area. Kismet
works with any 802.11b wireless card which is capable of reporting raw
packets (rfmon support), which include any prism2 based card (Linksys,
D-Link, Rangelan, etc), Cisco Aironet cards, and Orinoco based cards.
Kismet also supports the WSP100 802.11b remote sensor by Network
Chemistry and is able to monitor 802.11a networks with cards which use
the ar5k chipset.
