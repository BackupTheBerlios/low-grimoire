DESC="Demeter is a cross-platform C++ library that renders 3D terrains using OpenGL.
Demeter is a cross-platform C++ library that renders 3D terrains using
OpenGL. Demeter is designed for fast performance and good visual quality
and makes use of advanced techniques such as dynamic tessellation (adaptive
mesh) to render vast landscapes in real-time, without the need for high-end
hardware. It is written as a stand-alone component that can be easily
integrated into any kind of application.
