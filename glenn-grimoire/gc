    SHORT="Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage collector for C malloc or C++ new."
LONG="
The Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage collector can be used as a
garbage collecting replacement for C malloc or C++ new. It allows you to
allocate memory basically as you normally would, without explicitly
deallocating memory that is no longer useful. The collector automatically
recycles memory when it determines that it can no longer be otherwise
accessed.
