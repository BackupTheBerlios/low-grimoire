DESC="Libcoaster is a library designed with the goal of central preferences control on burners.
Libcoaster is a library designed with one goal. Central preferences control
on burners. What this means is, one setting for all applications that use
libcoaster. This allows the user to get what is needed done, done in a timely
manner. No more having to reconfigure preferences for an application that
uses a burner. Also, libcoaster brings uniformity to the desktop with
shared capplets and logging capabilities. Libcoaster, however, is not a
wrapper library for libburn. Libburn is required only to poll devices and
their capabilities.
