DESC="Open Producer (or simply Producer) is a cross-platform C++/OpenGL library that is focused on Camera control.
Open Producer (or simply Producer) is a cross-platform C++/OpenGL library
that is focused on Camera control. Producer's Camera provides projection,
field of view, viewpoint control, and frame control. Further, Producer can
be used in a multi-tasking environment to allow multiple Camera's to run
in parallel supporting hardware configurations with multiple display
subsystems. Threading, Camera synchronization and frame rate control are
simplified in the Producer programming interface.
