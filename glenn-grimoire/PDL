DESC="The perlDL project aims to turn perl into an efficient numerical language for scientific computing.
The perlDL project aims to turn perl into an efficient numerical language for
scientific computing. The PDL module gives standard perl the ability to
COMPACTLY store and SPEEDILY manipulate the large N-dimensional data sets which
are the bread and butter of scientific computing. e.g. \$a=\$b+\$c can add two
2048x2048 images in only a fraction of a second.
