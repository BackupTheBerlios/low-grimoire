DESC="WW is a file publishing tool with bandwidth sharing and integrity checking.
White Water allows people with limited or metered bandwidth to publish
files for download by thousands of people without saturating their
bandwidth. Downloaders participate by distributing chunks of the file
amongst themselves but gain by downloading several parts of the file
simultaneously. The download speed will generally be limited only by the
downloaders own bandwidth, not that of the publisher.
