LONG="
OSSP cfg is a ISO-C library for parsing arbitrary C/C++-style
configuration files. A configuration is sequence of directives. Each
directive consists of zero or more tokens. Each token can be either a
string or again a complete sequence. This means the configuration syntax
has a recursive structure and this way allows to create configurations
with arbitrarily nested sections.
