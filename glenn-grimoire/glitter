LONG="
Glitter is an interactive GUI program for extracting binaries from
newsgroups. It provides a powerful mechanism for filtering files to
ensure that you retrieve only the binaries that you want. You may also
schedule the binary download for a convenient time, perhaps when you are
asleep, when charges are low and the network is not congested.
