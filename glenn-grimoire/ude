DESC="The UDE-Project is creating a new WM.
The UDE-Project is creating a new WM which will be a complete GUI in
future. The project does not use any special GUI-Libraries such as QT
or GTK+. We just use the standard Xlibs (also to make UDE faster). UDE
is also not in any way like Windows, UDE has a new Look\'n\'Feel.
UDE - Get used to it!
