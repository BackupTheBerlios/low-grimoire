      DESC="LibTorrent is a BitTorrent library written in C++ for *nix.
LibTorrent is a BitTorrent library written in C++ for *nix.
It is designed to avoid redundant copying and storing of data
that other clients and libraries suffer from.
Basic features have been implemented and a ncurses client is
included. Sloppy and biased test runs have shown that transferring
a 200 MB file with libTorrent uses 1/4 of the CPU time that the 
official BitTorrent client requires.
The library and client are under heavy development.
They are stable enough to handle any torrents thrown at them
these days, although performance still requires some work."
