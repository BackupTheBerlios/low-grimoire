      DESC="DirectVNC uses the linux framebuffer device through DirectFB which enables it to run on anything that has a framebuffer.
What makes DirectVNC different from other unix vnc clients is
that it uses the linux framebuffer device through the DirectFB
library which enables it to run on anything that has a
framebuffer without the need for a running X server. This
includes embedded devices. DirectFB even uses acceleration
features of certain graphics cards.
