DESC="XBase manipulates dBase, Clipper, FoxPro, etc. compatible databases.
We define XBase here to mean any dBase, Clipper, FoxPro, etc. compatible
database (including index and memo files). Currently, XBase supports DBF
(dBase and other) database files, NDX (dbase) and NTX (Clipper) index files,
and DBT (dBase and other) memo field files. xBase (with a lowercase 'x')
means the xBase library. We hope to add support for other XBase file
formats in the future.
