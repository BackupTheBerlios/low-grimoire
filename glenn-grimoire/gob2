DESC="GOB2 is a preprocessor for making GObjects with inline C code.
GOB (GOB2 anyway) is a preprocessor for making GObjects with inline C code
so that generated files are not edited. Syntax is inspired by Java and Yacc
or Lex. The implementation is intentionally kept simple, and no C actual
code parsing is done.
