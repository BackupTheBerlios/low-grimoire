DESC="Mergeant is a program which helps administer a DBMS database using the gnome-db framework.
Mergeant is a program which helps administer a DBMS database using the gnome-db
framework (see http://www.gnome.org/gnome-db/ for more information about
gnome-db). Basically, it memorizes all the structure of the database, and some
queries, and does the SQL queries instead of the user (not having to type all
over again those SQL commands, although it is still possible to do so).
