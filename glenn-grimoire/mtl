The Matrix Template Library (MTL) is a high-performance generic component
library that provides comprehensive linear algebra functionality for a
wide variety of matrix formats. 

As with the Standard Template Library (STL), MTL uses a five-fold approach,
consisting of generic functions, containers, iterators, adaptors, and
function objects, all developed specifically for high performance numerical
linear algebra. Within this framework, MTL provides generic algorithms
corresponding to the mathematical operations that define linear algebra.
Similarly, the containers, adaptors, and iterators are used to represent
and to manipulate concrete linear algebra objects such as matrices and
vectors.
