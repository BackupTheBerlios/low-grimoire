DESC="WindowLab is a small and simple window manager of novel design

Windowlab has click-to-focus, shares its window depth policy with the Amiga, 
and has a window resizing/reshaping method similar to that of 8½ from 
Plan 9. WindowLab maintains the illusion of direct manipulation by 
constraining the mouse pointer when appropriate, ie when a window 
cannot be dragged any further in one direction.
