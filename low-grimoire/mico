DESC="MICO Is COrba

  The acronym MICO expands to MICO Is CORBA. The intention of this project is to 
  provide a freely available and fully compliant implementation of the CORBA 2.2 
  standard. MICO has become quite popular as an OpenSource project and is widely 
  used for different purposes (see our success stories). Our goal is to keep MICO 
  compliant to the latest CORBA standard.
