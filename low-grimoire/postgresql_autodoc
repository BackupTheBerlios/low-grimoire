DESC="Utility to output the schema of a database in XML

Postgresql AutoDoc has the ability to output XML, which can be 
loaded into Dia to create a UML diagram of the database 
(complete with table relations and descriptive information), 
an HTML form for further detailed information, GraphViz .dot output, 
and Docbook 4.1 style SGML for inclusion with project documentation 
as an appendix. It works on any 7.x PostgreSQL-based database.
