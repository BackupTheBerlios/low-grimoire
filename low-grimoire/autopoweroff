DESC=" Autopoweroff is a python script that is started at boot time, and which function is to shutdown the computer at a specific time, but only if some conditions are met

Autopoweroff is a script that shuts down a computer at a specific time, 
but only if some conditions are met. It works well on home router/firewalls 
where the machine can be switched off every night and powered back up in 
the morning. It can be configured to only shut down the server after any 
computers which depend on the server for Internet access have been shut down.
