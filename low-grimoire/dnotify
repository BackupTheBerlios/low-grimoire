dnotify is a simple program that makes it possible to execute a command every time the 
contents of a specific directory change in linux. It is run from the command line and 
takes two arguments: one or more directories to monitor and a command to execute whenever 
a directory has changed. Options control what events to trigger on: 
when a file was read in the directory, when one was created, deleted and so on.
