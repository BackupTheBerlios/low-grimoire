DESC="Smarty is a template engine for PHP

Smarty is a template engine for PHP. Many other template engines for 
PHP provide basic variable substitution and dynamic block functionality. 
Smarty takes a step further to be a "smart" template engine, adding features 
such as configuration files, template functions, and variable modifiers, 
and making all of this functionality as easy as possible to use for both 
programmers and template designers. Smarty also converts the templates into 
PHP scripts, eliminating the need to parse the templates on every invocation. 
This makes Smarty extremely scalable and managable for large application needs.
