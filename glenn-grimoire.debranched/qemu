QEMU is a FAST! processor emulator using dynamic translation to achieve
good emulation speed. 

QEMU has two operating modes:
*Full system emulation. In this mode, QEMU emulates a full system (for
example a PC), including a processor and various peripherials. It can be
used to launch different Operating Systems without rebooting the PC or to
debug system code. 
*User mode emulation (Linux host only). In this mode, QEMU can launch Linux
processes compiled for one CPU on another CPU. It can be used to launch the
Wine Windows API emulator (http://www.winehq.org) or to ease
cross-compilation and cross-debugging.
