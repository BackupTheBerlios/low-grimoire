Cscope is a developer's tool for browsing source code. It has an impeccable
Unix pedigree, having been originally developed at Bell Labs back in the
days of the PDP-11. Cscope was part of the official AT&T Unix distribution
for many years, and has been used to manage projects involving 20 million
lines of code!
