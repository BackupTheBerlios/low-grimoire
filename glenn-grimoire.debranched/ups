LONG="
Ups is a source level C,C++ and Fortran debugger that runs under X11.
Currently supported systems are FreeBSD and GNU/Linux on Intel x86 and
Solaris on SPARC. On these systems it runs native; it is not a front-end
to GNU gdb. An ANSI C interpreter is included; this is built in to ups to
provide conditional debugging and can also be built as a seperate program.
