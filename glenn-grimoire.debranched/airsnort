DESC="AirSnort is a wireless LAN (WLAN) tool which recovers encryption keys.
AirSnort is a wireless LAN (WLAN) tool which recovers encryption keys.
AirSnort operates by passively monitoring transmissions, computing the
encryption key when enough packets have been gathered. 

802.11b, using the Wired Equivalent Protocol (WEP), is crippled with
numerous security flaws. Most damning of these is the weakness described
in \" Weaknesses in the Key Scheduling Algorithm of RC4 \" by Scott Fluhrer,
Itsik Mantin and Adi Shamir. Adam Stubblefield was the first to implement
this attack, but he has not made his software public. AirSnort, along with
WEPCrack, which was released about the same time as AirSnort, are the
first publicly available implementaions of this attack.
