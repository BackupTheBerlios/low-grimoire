devices. It currently works under Linux with devices that are supported by
the wireless extensions by Jean Tourrilhes (included in Kernel 2.4 and
higher), e.g. the Lucent Orinoco cards.

Key features:
- overview screen, displaying all important information like device
  configuration, encryption and power management parameters and network
  information at once
- adaptive level bargraphs for link quality, signal/noise strength and
  signal-to-noise ratio
- customizeable \"level alarm\" feature that notices the user of changes in
  signal level strength audibly and/or visually
- full-screen level histogram displaying signal/noise levels and SNR
- list of access points in range
- menu-based configuration from within the program
