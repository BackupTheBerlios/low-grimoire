    SHORT="Driftnet is a program which listens to network traffic and picks out images from TCP streams it observes."
LONG="
Inspired by EtherPEG (though, not owning an Apple Macintosh, I\'ve never
actually seen it in operation), Driftnet is a program which listens to
network traffic and picks out images from TCP streams it observes. Fun
to run on a host which sees lots of web traffic.
