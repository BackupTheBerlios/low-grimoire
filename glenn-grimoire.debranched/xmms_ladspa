LONG="
XMMS LADSPA is an Effect for XMMS that provides (some of) the power of the
Linux Audio Developer\'s Simple Plugin API to your everyday MP3 and
all-around media player.

Normally XMMS can only handle a single Effect, such as Echo and it has to
be written specifically for XMMS. With XMMS LADSPA you can use any number
of audio processing plugins written to the LADSPA specification, which
includes all the GPL software at plugin.org.uk maintained by Steve Harris.
