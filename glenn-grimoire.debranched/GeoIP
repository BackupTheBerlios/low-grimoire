LONG="
GeoIP is a C library that enables the user to find the country that any
IP address or hostname originates from.  It uses a file based database
that is accurate as of March 2003.  This database simply contains IP
blocks as keys, and countries as values.  This database should be more
complete and accurate than using reverse DNS lookups.
