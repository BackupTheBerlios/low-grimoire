DESC="gtkdialog is a GUI-creation utility that can be used with an arbitrary interpreter.
gtkdialog is a GUI-creation utility that can be used with an arbitrary
interpreter. Developers can describe a graphical user interface in a simple
XML-like language, and use it with any interpreter that supports either
files, standard I/O, or environment variables. It can be called as an
external program from the interpreter or used as a stand-alone framework
for the application. Stand-alone, bash, and awk examples are provided.
