LibGII (General Input Interface) is intended to be to input what our LibGGI
(General Graphics Interface) library is to graphics.

The goal of LibGII is to provide a single easy to use, but yet powerful,
API for all possible input sources. However we are not there yet. The
API is far from set in stone yet, and is likely to change.
