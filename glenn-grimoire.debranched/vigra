DESC="VIGRA stands for \"Vision with Generic Algorithms\".
VIGRA stands for \"Vision with Generic Algorithms\". It's a novel computer
vision library that puts its main emphasize on customizable algorithms and
data structures. By using template techniques similar to those in the C++
Standard Template Library, you can easily adapt any VIGRA component to the
needs of your application, without thereby giving up execution speed.
