DESC="QuickThreads is a toolkit for building threads packages.
QuickThreads is a toolkit for building threads packages.  It is my hope
that you'll find it easier to use QuickThreads normally than to take it
and modify the raw cswap code to fit your application.  The idea behind
QuickThreads is that it should make it easy for you to write & retarget
threads packages.
