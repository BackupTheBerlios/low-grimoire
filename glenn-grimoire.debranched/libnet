LONG="
Libnet is a high-level API (toolkit) allowing the application programmer to
construct and inject network packets. It provides a portable and simplified
interface for low-level network packet shaping, handling and injection.
Libnet hides much of the tedium of packet creation from the application
programmer such as multiplexing, buffer management, arcane packet header
information, byte-ordering, OS-dependent issues, and much more. Libnet
features portable packet creation interfaces at the IP layer and link
layer, as well as a host of supplementary and complementary functionality.
Using libnet, quick and simple packet assembly applications can be whipped
up with little effort. With a bit more time, more complex programs can be
written (Traceroute and ping were easily rewritten using libnet and
libpcap).
