DESC="C++ threads class that relies on no underlying C code.
The aim of this library, is to provide the programmer with an easy to use
class, that can be further inherited to provide a rich set of threaded
functionality rarely seen in a linux environment. Full C++ is provided,
without any wrapping around underlying C code, which gives more compact
and faster objects.
