LONG="
Do'SSi Zo'la is a board game under GPL licence, using SDL. You can play
with two players or you can play on your own against the computer.

The goal of the game is quite simple: block your opponent by destroying
the fields which surround him without being blocked yourself. Every turn
of play, each player must first move to some adjacent field and then
destroy a field of his choice. The first player who cannot move anymore
loses the game.
