    SHORT="SooperLooper is a looping sampler ladspa plugin"
LONG="
SooperLooper is a looping sampler very much like the Gibson/Oberheim
Echoplex Digital Pro (EDP). In fact, it is a downright emulation of an
EDP, with some additional features and a silly name. I figured that the
EDP feature-set is powerful, proven, and popular -- so why not implement
it as a LADSPA plugin we can all use?
