DESC="Devil's Pie can be configured to detect windows as they are created, and match the window to a set of rules.
A window-matching utility, inspired by Sawfish's \"Matched Windows\" option
and the lack of the functionality in Metacity. Metacity lacking window
matching is not a bad thing -- Metacity is a lean window manager, and
window matching does not have to be a window manager task. 

Devil's Pie can be configured to detect windows as they are created, and
match the window to a set of rules. If the window matches the rules, it
can perform a series of actions on that window. For example, I make all
windows created by X-Chat appear on all workspaces, and the main Gkrellm1
window does not appear in the pager or task list.
