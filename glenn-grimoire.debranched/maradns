DESC="MaraDNS is a security aware DNS server.
MaraDNS is a package that implements the Domain Name Service (DNS), an
essential internet service. MaraDNS is intended for environments where a
DNS server must be secure and where the server must use the absolute
minimum number of resources possible. MaraDNS was created in response to
issues people had with the DNS servers available in early 2001.
