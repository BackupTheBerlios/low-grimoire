Film Gimp is a motion picture editing tool primarily used for painting and
retouching of movies. Its application to feature movie productions includes
the movies Scooby-Doo, Harry Potter, and Stuart Little. Film Gimp is the
most successful open source tool in feature motion picture work today. Film
Gimp runs on Linux and SGI Irix. A Windows version is planned for release in
December 2002, and Macintosh native in 2003.

Film Gimp is a motion picture editing tool primarily used for painting
and retouching of movies. With sixteen bits per component instead of
eight, Film Gimp has much more color depth capacity than Gimp.
Spencer Kimball and Peter Mattis created Gimp originally, releasing the
first version (0.54) in 1995. Gimp is a widely-used alternative to
Adobe Photoshop, a popular tool for professional image editing.
Film Gimp extended Gimp to operate upon a series of images and in
16-bit linear and floating point color depths. Film Gimp is currently
based upon the HOLLYWOOD 1.0.4 branch of Gimp.
