DESC="Swarming downloader.

BitTorrent is a tool for distributing files. It's extremely 
easy to use - downloads are started by clicking on hyperlinks.
Whenever more than one person is downloading at once 
they send pieces of the file(s) to each other, thus relieving 
the central server's bandwidth burden. Even with many 
simultaneous downloads, the upload burden on the central server 
remains quite small, since each new downloader introduces new 
upload capacity.
