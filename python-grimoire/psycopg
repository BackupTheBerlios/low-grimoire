DESC="psycopg is a PostgreSQL database adapter for Python

psycopg is a PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python 
programming language. Its main advantages are that it supports 
the full Python DBAPI 2.0 and it is thread safe at level 2. 
It was designed for heavily multi-threaded applications that 
create and destroy lots of cursors and make a conspicuous 
number of concurrent INSERTs or UPDATEs.
