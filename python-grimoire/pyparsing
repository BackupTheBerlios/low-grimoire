DESC="pyparsing is a general parsing module for Python.
pyparsing is a general parsing module for Python. Grammars are implemented
directly in the client code using parsing objects, instead of externally,
as with lex/yacc-type tools. Includes simple examples for parsing SQL,
CORBA IDL, and 4-function math.
