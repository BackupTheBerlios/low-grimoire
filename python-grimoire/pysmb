DESC="pysmb is an experimental SMB/CIFS library written in Python

The library has been tested to be able to connect Win 98 SE and Samba 
2.0 machines, and upload/download files to and from these machines. 
Unfortunately, some users have reported that pysmb is unable to work 
with Windows 2000 and Windows XP in version 0.3.1 and earlier. Version 
0.4.0 has been tested to work with Win2K.
