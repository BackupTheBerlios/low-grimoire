DESC="Python module to run java bytecode from python.
The javaclass collection of packages and utilities (also known as
ClassFile) provides a means of importing Java classes and packages directly
into Python, without the need for a Java virtual machine, so that the
classes may be instantiated, accessed, run and manipulated just like Python
classes, and that the resulting objects and methods can be accessed and
manipulated just like Python objects and methods. It should be possible to
run compiled Java programs with the Python interpreter and not notice that
it isn't the Java virtual machine being used - given sufficient library
support for the program concerned, of course.
