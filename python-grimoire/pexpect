DESC="Pexpect is a Pure Python Expect-like module.
Pexpect is a Pure Python Expect-like module.
Pexpect makes Python a better tool for controlling other applications.
Pexpect is a pure Python module for spawning child applications; controlling them;
and responding to expected patterns in their output. Pexpect works like Don Libes'
Expect. Pexpect allows your script to spawn a child application and control it as if a
human were typing commands.
