DESC="python-irclib is a event-driven IRC client framework written in Python, as well as an object-oriented wrapper class
python-irclib is a event-driven IRC client framework written in Python,
as well as an object-oriented wrapper class
The main features of the IRC client framework are:
 *Abstraction of the IRC protocol.
 *Handles multiple simultaneous IRC server connections.
 *Handles server PONGing transparently.
 *Messages to the IRC server are done by calling methods on an IRC
  connection object.
 *Messages from an IRC server triggers events, which can be caught by
  event handlers.
 *Reading from and writing to IRC server sockets are normally done by an
  internal select() loop, but the select()ing may be done by an external
  main loop.
 *Functions can be registered to execute at specified times by the
  event-loop.
 *Decodes CTCP tagging correctly (hopefully); I haven't seen any other
  IRC client implementation that handles the CTCP specification subtilties.
 *A kind of simple, single-server, object-oriented IRC client class that
  dispatches events to instance methods is included.
 *DCC connection support.
