DESC="wxGlade is a GUI designer for wxPython/wxWindows

wxGlade is a GUI designer written in Python with the popular 
GUI toolkit wxPython, that helps you create wxWindows/wxPython 
user interfaces. At the moment it can generate Python, C++ and 
XRC (wxWindows' XML resources) code.As you can guess by the name, 
its model is Glade, the famous GTK+/GNOME GUI builder, with which 
wxGlade shares the philosophy and the look & feel (but not a line of code).
It is not (and will never be) a full featured IDE, but simply a 
\"designer\": the generated code does nothing apart from displaying 
the created widgets. If you are looking for a complete IDE, maybe 
Boa Constructor or PythonCard is the right tool.
