DESC="rdiff-backup is a backup utility

rdiff-backup is a backup utility that backs up 
one directory to another, possibly over a network.
The target directory ends up a copy of the source directory, 
but extra reverse diffs are stored in a special subdirectory 
of that target directory, so you can still recover files lost 
some time ago.
