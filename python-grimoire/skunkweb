DESC="An extensible, scalable, easy to use Web application server written in Python

SkunkWeb is a scalable, extensible, and easy-to-use Web application server written 
in Python. It is designed for handling both high-traffic sites and smaller sites. 
Its features include a powerful component model and an elegant templating language 
that encourages component-based design, highly configurable caching 
(on disk and/or in memory) of compiled templates and component output, 
message catalog support for i18n, and remote component calls. It can be used with 
Apache via an Apache module, or it can serve HTTP requests directly.
