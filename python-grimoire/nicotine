Nicotine is a feature-complete client for the SoulSeek filesharing network. You can use it to upload, download, 
search, and chat. You can keep a \"buddy\" list and basically everything else a SoulSeek client is supposed to do. 
If you are familiar with PySoulSeek, you'll probably notice a striking resemblance in appearance.
