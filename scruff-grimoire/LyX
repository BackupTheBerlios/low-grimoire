LyX is an advanced open source document processor that encourages an
approach to writing based on the structure of your documents, not their
appearance. LyX lets you concentrate on writing, leaving details of visual
layout to the software.

LyX runs on many Unix platforms, OS/2, and under Windows/Cygwin (this port
requires an X server). It can also run natively on Mac OS X, thanks to the
Qt/Mac library.

LyX produces high quality, professional output -- using LaTeX, an industrial
strength typesetting engine, in the background; LyX is far more than a
front-end to LaTeX, however. No knowledge of LaTeX is necessary to use LyX,
although it will give a user more power.

LyX is stable and fully featured. It has been used for documents as large as
a thesis, or as small as a business letter. Despite its simple GUI interface
(available in many languages), it supports tables, figures, and hyperlinked
cross-references, and has a best-of-breed math editor.
