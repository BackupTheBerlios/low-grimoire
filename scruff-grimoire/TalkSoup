TalkSoup is an IRC client using either the GNUstep frameworks or the Mac OS
X frameworks. It has a minimalistic feel and is by far one of the most
extensible designs in existence. With its very modular design, one can load
bundles/plugins to extend the IRC client to be as fully featured as one
desires.
